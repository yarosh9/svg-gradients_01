An exploration of **vector gradients** and the creation of collections from them is an attempt to study the digital alchemy that creates an infinitely beautiful world on our screens. Numbers collected into code are a new nature permeating our material reality. Gradients are a reflection on how simple code can be beautiful and how little is needed for this.

## Content

* [Gradients](./svg)
* Other folders contain gradients for sets.

Future research includes patterns and, of course, paths. But there is still much to explore in gradients!

## Inspiration  

This collection is about the **beauty of pure gradients**—simple yet powerful color transitions that bring depth and emotion to designs.  

## How to Use  

- Download the SVG files and use them in your projects  
- Modify colors and shapes as needed  
- Combine them for unique effects  

## Thanks

Many thanks to the **MDN team** and their gradients section, which inspired me to create these studies and collections:

* [SVG on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)
* [SVG Gradients on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Gradients)

Great appreciation to **Cy Twombly**, whose works and philosophy have inspired and continue to inspire!
