# Gradients Garden

An exploration of **vector gradients** and the creation of collections from them is an attempt to study the digital alchemy that creates an infinitely beautiful world on our screens. Numbers collected into code are a new nature permeating our material reality. Gradients are a reflection on how simple code can be beautiful and how little is needed for this.

This collection is about the **beauty of pure gradients**â€”simple yet powerful color transitions that bring depth and emotion to designs.  

## How to Use  

- Download the SVG files and use them in your projects  
- Modify colors and shapes as needed  
- Combine them for unique effects
